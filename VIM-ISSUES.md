## Telescope narrowing down should work

However, when trying to narrow down the search using my function like this:

*B*
.*B.*
.*B
*B

The results are empty for some reason. Debug why.

## Make some shortcuts to highlight line with vim-highlighter

Do I really need it?

## Duplicated phantom line when scrolling

Sometimes scrolling up and down results in some line being renderingly duplicated (without the line
actually duplicating in a file), which results in confusing editing

## Being able to fold by shortcut, rather than by:
:'<,'>fold<enter>

####  Making a link from bitbucket or arcadia with gitlinker would honestly feel so nice
DONE from bitbucket, from arcadia not really possible without serious patching

#### Automatic restoration of highlighting done with vim-highlighter

#### Fix envr again
